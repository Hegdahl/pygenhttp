# pygenhttp
A http server written using python generators as an experiment to learn about how async libraries work.

I do not recommend using this software for anything other than learning or having fun, because it will probably be very cumbersome to use since its based on generators instead of async functions, and it will also probably be very slow since its my first attempt at making an http server.
